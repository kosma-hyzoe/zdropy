# zdropy

An automation tool using Selenium and Python `schedule`
built with ASAP-registration in mind. 

## IMPORTANT NOTE 

This program is currently being developed as a final project for Harvard's
[CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). The required project structure
is a little awkward, so I decided to keep it on a separate branch until
it's finished (in a demo/alpha version of course). If you're curious how
I'm doing, please see the branch called `cs50`.
